Write a SQL Statement on EMP Table, which shows the names of employees, job and
salary whose job is Salesman and the employee’s name has an E in it.

SELECT ename, job, salary
FROM emp
WHERE job = 'SALESMAN'

of all those employees who a manager or a salesman are and having ‘A’ at second or third place and
salary between 1000 and 2500 and not hired in ‘FEB’ and ‘MAY’, sorted by annual salary in descending

SELECT ename, sal, hiredate, (sal * 12) as 'Annual_Sal', job 
FROM emp
WHERE (JOB = 'SALESMAN' OR JOB = 'MANAGER')
AND (ename LIKE '_A%' OR ename LIKE '__A%')
AND sal BETWEEN 1000 and 2500
AND (hiredate LIKE '%FEB%' OR hiredate LIKE '%MAY%')
ORDER BY Annual_sal DESC


Question 3: 
Display the ename, job, hiredate, sal and deptno of all employees whose manager id is
not 7839 and the commission must not be null. And the hiredate is between 21-Feb-81 and 17-Dec81.
Sort the result by salary and then by commission in descending order.

SELECT ename, job, hiredate, sal, deptno
FROM emp 
WHERE mgr NOT IN ('7839')
AND comm IS NOT NULL
AND (hiredate BETWEEN '21-Feb-81' and '17-Dec81')
ORDER BY sal
ORDER BY comm DESC


Question 4: 
Display employee names who have two ‘A’ in their names as “Name”, position of the
second occurrence of ‘A’ in the employee names as “Position”, and salary as “Salary”.

FROM emp e
WHERE ename LIKE '%A%A%';


Question 5: 
Display employee name with their first and last letter capitalized, and rest of letters
lowercase for all the employees whose name start with A, M and B. Sort the results by employee
name.

SELECT CONCAT(CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(ENAME,1,1))),CONCAT (LOWER(SUBSTR(ENAME,2,LENGHT(ENAME)-1))), UPPER(SUBSTR(ENAME,LENGTH(ENAME))))
FROM emp e
WHERE ename LIKE 'A%'
AND ename LIKE 'M%'
AND ename LIKE 'B%'
ORDER BY ename;


Question 6: 
Create a query that will display the total salary of each department in ascending order.

SELECT SUM(sal) AS 'TOTAL_SAL'
FROM emp 
GROUP BY deptno
ORDER BY SUM(sal) ACS;


Question 7: 
Display ename as “Name”, department number as “Department”, and 15% incremented
salary as“Incremented_Salary”, and salary of those employee whose job is clerk or salesman and
whose salary is not equal to $1250, $1300, or $1400 and whose name contains an “A”. 

SELECT ename AS 'NAME', deptno AS 'DEPARTMENT' ,(sal+sal*0.15) AS 'INCREMENTED_SALARY', sal
FROM emp 
WHERE (job = 'CLERK' OR job = 'SALESMAN')
AND sal NOT IN (1250,1300,1400)
AND ename LIKE '%A%';



Question 8: 
Write an SQL statement, which retrieves the names of employees along with their
department numbers and the names of their colleagues who work in the same department but have

SELECT e.ename, deptno, c.ename
FROM emp e,emp c
WHERE e.deptno = c.deptno
